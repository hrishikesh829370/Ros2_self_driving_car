# Ros2_self_driving_car
A Level 3 Self driving car with OSRF packages. 
The City has been designed in Blender, simulated in Gazebo with ROS2 Framework. 
A Perception Pipeline has been created for lane detection and traffic signal recognition. 
An advanced control algorithm for navigating T-junctions , intersections and for cruise control has been implemented.
Utilized custom CNN for object classification and Implemented Dijkstra's and A* algorithms for path planning

Ros2_Self-Driving_Car

This project implements a Level 3 self-driving car using OSRF packages within the ROS2 framework. A Level 3 self-driving car can operate conditionally under specific environmental conditions and may require human intervention in some situations.

Functionalities:

    Designed a city environment in Blender and simulated it in Gazebo.
    Developed a perception pipeline for lane detection and traffic signal recognition.
    Implemented an advanced control algorithm for navigating T-junctions, intersections, and cruise control.
    Utilized a custom CNN for object classification.
    Implemented Dijkstra's and A* algorithms for path planning.

The World:

world: 

A realistic city environment created in Blender and simulated in Gazebo.

Traffic Signal Recognition:

traffic_signal:

The car identifies the traffic signal (red light) and comes to a stop.
